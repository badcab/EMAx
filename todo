these are some things I need to do
KEY - = partly done, -- = done but not full tested

event model needs cost (get only)

fix the issue with no zip (maybe in the return NULL line inside of the zip model?)

add warnings for unacceptable form fill outedness

add double book protection

-finish triggers and stored procedure

tool tip niceify

--default admin login, accept any password

-password salting should involve the user name

add event cost to views but it is not directly editable

ability to delete users (admin only)

-remove programmatic fk resolution

for misslanious fix so that tabs do not reset every time a query is made (note keep this behavior for search as this is an event centeric program)
