these are some things I need to do

update event and org to handle extra checkbox

add is outagame county CB to org

two event alters need model update

county alter in org needs model update

fix the issue with no zip (maybe in the return NULL line inside of the zip model?)

add warnings for unacceptable form fill outed ness

add double book protection

-finish triggers and stored procedure

tool tip niceify

select person on edit mutliple entery error (may require a simple expantion of js and used of .remove()

-FF compatability test

on save redirect to view of the saved event

--maximize jquery use for cross browser support

--default admin login, accept any password

-password salting should involve the user name

add event cost to views but it is not dirrectly editable

--protect against sql injection

abitlity to delete users (admin only)

-remove programatic fk resolution

instead of default view on save the isolated view should be called

we will need to have the big three return ID also

add person and org seem to be the same thing, must investigate further (it is only a problem for adding)

-make all js into one or two large objects
